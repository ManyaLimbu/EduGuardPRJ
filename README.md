## EduGaurd - Automated Exam Proctoring tool for Online Exams using Face Recognition

### ðŸš© Overview 
During COVID 19 pandemic, online education has become a common norm in schools and colleges, and students themselves are adapted to this online environment of education, as classes are being held in online mode, exams are also conducted online and students tend to cheat in those exams due to lack of security and no physical guarding by professors/teachers which is monitored live, so here is my solution to the problem! Now teachers can monitor students' live even in online mode!

## ðŸš© Future Scopes:-

Feature | Explanation
------------ | -------------
Creating Exam Feature in the application itself| Instead of using a external link(google/microsoft forms),exam creation in the web-application itself would provide more security and better user experience to the product.
Class Management | All class management activities (branch/section wise) separately for every year students, creating assignment in the application itself assigning tasks and keep a record of every student activites individually in different sections.
Video Calling support | Video calling support between students and teacher for quick doubt resolve and better teacher to student interaction
